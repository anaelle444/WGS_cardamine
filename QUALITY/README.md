# Quality Control Scripts

This README describes the quality control scripts used in the pipeline to ensure the integrity and quality of sequencing data.

**01_fastqc.sh**

- **input**: .fastq
- **output**: .html (quality reports)

This script runs FastQC on the raw FASTQ files to generate quality control reports. FastQC provides a comprehensive overview of the quality of the sequencing reads, including metrics such as per-base sequence quality, per-sequence quality scores, and sequence duplication levels.

**02_multiqc.sh**

- **input**: Quality reports from FastQC (.html)
- **output**: .html (summary report)

This script aggregates the quality control reports generated by FastQC using MultiQC. MultiQC combines the individual reports into a single comprehensive HTML report, providing an overview of quality metrics across all samples, making it easier to assess the overall data quality.

**03_depth_of_coverage.sh**

- **input**: .bam
- **output**: .txt (coverage statistics)

This script calculates the depth of coverage for each sample using bedtools or samtools. The depth of coverage is an important metric that indicates how many times each base in the genome is covered by sequencing reads. The output is a text file containing coverage statistics, such as mean coverage, median coverage, and coverage distribution.
